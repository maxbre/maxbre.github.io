Stink pipe in Woodside Grange Road, North Finchley,
manufactured by H. J. Rogers of Watford. 
Stink pipes (formally called sewer ventilation pipes) were installed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to carry flammable and noxious gases from sewers to a safe height above the street.
